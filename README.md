# The Coding Library

[![Build](https://github.com/Honigkuchen/the-coding-library/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Honigkuchen/the-coding-library/actions/workflows/build.yml)

This is a collection of coding algorithms.
Algorithms were mostly derived from Wikipedia and other sources.
This repository originates as a coding challenge for myself.

None of these algorithms is designed/optimized to be actually fast or efficient.
